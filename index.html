            <h2>Biography - The Journey of The Notorious</h2>
            
            <div class="bio-content">
                <h3>🏠 Early Life (1988-2006)</h3>
                <p>Conor Anthony McGregor was born on July 14, 1988, in Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland. He grew up in a working-class Irish family with his parents Tony and Margaret, and his two sisters, Erin and Aoife. As a child, McGregor was passionate about sports and played football for Lourdes Celtic Football Club. At the age of 12, he took up boxing at Crumlin Boxing Club to develop his fighting skills and discipline.</p>
                <p>McGregor left school at 17 and became a plumbing apprentice. However, his passion for combat sports continued to grow, and he eventually decided to pursue a career in mixed martial arts.</p>

                <h3>🥊 Early MMA Career (2007-2012)</h3>
                <p>In 2008, at age 18, McGregor made his mixed martial arts debut. He began training at Straight Blast Gym (SBG) in Dublin under coach John Kavanagh, who would become a pivotal figure in his career. During this time, McGregor competed in various Irish and European MMA promotions while working as a plumber to support himself.</p>
                <p>His talent quickly became evident as he racked up wins and gained attention in the Irish MMA scene. In 2012, he became a two-division champion in the Cage Warriors promotion, holding both the featherweight and lightweight titles simultaneously - a preview of what he would later achieve in the UFC.</p>

                <h3>🌟 UFC Rise to Stardom (2013-2015)</h3>
                <p>McGregor signed with the UFC in February 2013. He made an explosive debut on April 6, 2013, at UFC on Fuel TV: Mousasi vs. Latifi, knocking out Marcus Brimage in just 67 seconds. This performance earned him the "Knockout of the Night" award and immediately put him on the map.</p>
                <p>Over the next two years, McGregor went on a tear through the featherweight division, defeating notable opponents including Diego Brandão, Dustin Poirier, Dennis Siver, and Chad Mendes. His charismatic personality, trash-talking abilities, and knockout power made him one of the UFC's biggest draws. He famously predicted the exact round in which he would finish his opponents, often proving himself right.</p>

                <h3>👑 Championship Glory (2015-2016)</h3>
                <p>On December 12, 2015, at UFC 194, McGregor achieved his dream of becoming UFC Featherweight Champion. He knocked out the long-reigning champion José Aldo in just 13 seconds - the fastest knockout in UFC title fight history. This moment solidified his status as a superstar.</p>
                <p>In 2016, McGregor moved up to welterweight for a non-title fight against Nate Diaz at UFC 196. Despite being a heavy favorite, he was submitted in the second round - his first UFC loss. However, he avenged this loss five months later at UFC 202, defeating Diaz by majority decision in an epic five-round war that became the highest-selling pay-per-view in UFC history at the time.</p>
                <p>On November 12, 2016, at UFC 205 in Madison Square Garden, New York, McGregor made history. He knocked out Eddie Alvarez in the second round to win the UFC Lightweight Championship, becoming the first fighter in UFC history to hold titles in two different weight divisions simultaneously.</p>

                <h3>🥊 The Money Fight (2017)</h3>
                <p>In what would become the biggest fight in combat sports history, McGregor crossed over to professional boxing to face undefeated boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. on August 26, 2017. Despite losing by TKO in the 10th round, the event generated over 4.3 million pay-per-view buys and more than $600 million in revenue. McGregor's guaranteed purse was reported to be around $100 million, making him one of the highest-paid athletes in the world.</p>

                <h3>🔥 UFC Return and Rivalries (2018-2020)</h3>
                <p>McGregor returned to the UFC on October 6, 2018, to face undefeated lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229. The fight was surrounded by intense rivalry and trash talk. Khabib won via submission in the fourth round, but the event became the highest-selling UFC pay-per-view of all time with 2.4 million buys. A post-fight brawl between both teams overshadowed the result.</p>
                <p>After a 15-month layoff, McGregor returned on January 18, 2020, at UFC 246, defeating Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone in just 40 seconds with a devastating TKO.</p>

                <h3>💼 Business Ventures</h3>
                <p>Beyond fighting, McGregor has proven to be a savvy businessman. In 2018, he launched Proper No. Twelve Irish Whiskey, which became one of the fastest-growing spirits brands in Ireland. In 2021, he sold his majority stake in the company for a reported $600 million.</p>
                <p>He has also ventured into fashion with his clothing line "August McGregor," published an autobiography, and signed numerous endorsement deals with major brands including Reebok, Burger King, and Beats by Dre.</p>

                <h3>💪 Legacy and Impact</h3>
                <p>Conor McGregor transcended mixed martial arts to become a global sports icon. He brought unprecedented mainstream attention to the UFC, helped negotiate fighter pay increases, and proved that combat sports athletes could achieve boxing-level paydays. His confidence, showmanship, and fighting ability changed the landscape of MMA forever.</p>
                <p>Whether loved or hated, McGregor remains one of the most influential and recognizable athletes in the world, with over 47 million Instagram followers and a legacy that extends far beyond the octagon.</p>

                <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 12, 2015</p>

                <p><strong>Title:</strong> Undisputed UFC Featherweight Championship</p>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This fight was the culmination of one of the most intense promotional campaigns in UFC history. McGregor had been calling out Aldo for over a year, engaging in psychological warfare that included stealing Aldo's belt during a press conference.

                <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 5, 2016</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada</p>

Nate Diaz stepped in on 11 days' notice at welterweight. McGregor started strong but began to tire in the second round. After being hurt by a combination from Diaz, McGregor shot for a takedown and was submitted. This was McGregor's first UFC loss and showed his vulnerability. The fight set up one of the biggest rematches in UFC history.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="fight-3">

                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> In the rematch, McGregor showed improved cardio and strategy. He dropped Diaz three times in the first two rounds but faced adversity in rounds 3 and 4 as Diaz rallied. McGregor dug deep in the fifth round to secure a majority decision victory. The back-and-forth nature of the fight made it an instant classic. At the time, it became the highest-selling UFC pay-per-view event ever with approximately 1.65 million buys.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="fight-4">

Mayweather's experience prevailed as he took control in the later rounds and stopped McGregor in the 10th.

The build-up included a bus attack by McGregor's team at a media event, resulting in arrests and lawsuits. The fight lived up to the hype, with McGregor showing resilience and even winning the third round, but Khabib's superior grappling dominated. After submitting McGregor, Khabib jumped the cage to attack McGregor's cornerman, sparking a massive brawl. Despite the chaos, the event became the highest-selling UFC pay-per-view of all time with 2.4 million buys, a record that still stands.</p>

                <p><strong>Result:</strong> McGregor wins by TKO (head kick and punches) at 0:40 of Round 1</p>
                <p><strong>Title:</strong> Welterweight bout (Non-title)</p>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> After a 15-month layoff, McGregor returned with a statement victory. He destroyed veteran Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone in just 40 seconds with a combination of shoulder strikes in the clinch, a head kick, and ground-and-pound. This was McGregor's fastest UFC finish and showed he still possessed devastating power and precision. The quick knockout reignited discussions about potential super-fights and title shots.</p>
