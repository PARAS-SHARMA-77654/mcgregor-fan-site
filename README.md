## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images Not Displaying?

If images are not showing on your website:

1. **Check folder structure** - Ensure all images are in the `photos/` folder
2. **Update HTML paths** - All image src attributes must include `photos/` prefix
3. **Find these lines in index.html and update them:**

```html
<!-- BEFORE (won't work if images are in photos folder) -->
<img src="WhatsApp Image 2025-12-26 at 3.06.25 PM (1).jpeg">

<!-- AFTER (correct path with photos folder) -->
<img src="photos/WhatsApp Image 2025-12-26 at 3.06.25 PM (1).jpeg">
```

4. **Quick Fix - Find & Replace in index.html:**
   - Find: `src="`
   - Replace with: `src="photos/`
   - (But be careful not to replace the SVG logo path!)

5. **Alternative**: Move all images from `photos/` folder to the root directory (same level as index.html)
